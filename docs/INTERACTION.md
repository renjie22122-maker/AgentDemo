## Navigation

Newly opened conversations start near the latest content. Steps can expand/collapse, with a compact live preview when folded. Round navigation locates user turns. The context/workspace strip opens detail panels; context pages and knowledge-maintenance progress load independently of slower statistics.

Thinking, collaboration and access controls sit near the composer. Display scaling offers Auto and 25/50/75/100/115/125/150%. Ordinary chats show chat files; project chats show registered roots. Custom names are preserved through the Amadeus rename.

## Live updates

Elapsed wall time includes model, tools and approval waits; terminal runs stop the timer. Durable follow-ups display pending until the next safe consumption point, not immediate model receipt. Background jobs permit independent work; a foreground command can still occupy the run.

The client reconnects up to five times with 1/2/4/8/16-second backoff; a healthy heartbeat resets the streak. Reconnection reauthenticates and restores durable state without resending operations. Event IDs suppress duplicates; large gaps refresh snapshots. Manual reconnect remains available. A mutation timeout is not evidence that it failed.

Questions and approvals appear at their chronological event positions. A global attention menu jumps to the relevant chat/card. Desktop notifications need browser permission and an open page; this is not a persistent Windows notification service. Generic notification text avoids exposing task content.

## Review and recovery

Run changes are grouped and collapsed, with red/green text differences, line counts and unified/before-after views. Snapshots exclude hidden/generated/linked/binary/oversized files and are bounded (400 entries, 2 MB, eight levels). They can observe user edits too; they are not undo or transaction isolation. Old events cannot recover absent before-images.

Unknown effects allow a read-only inspection continuation, not blind write/command replay. Exact full-content writes and recorded edit postimages can be reconciled automatically. resolve_effect may then ask for confirmation. “Allow another attempt” records explicit retry authorization while retaining the unknown prior outcome; it does not itself execute a command. Subsequent work retains normal approvals.

Approval waits have no expiry and do not consume command execution time. Stop/restart cancels waiters and exposes recovery; it never silently approves. Known pre-start errors are distinguished from unknown execution.

## Content and workspace preview

Markdown supports tables, math, code, attributed quotations and embedded media. HTML and Mermaid default to preview with a same-sized scrollable code view. See [formatting](CHAT-FORMATTING.md).

Workspace HTML preview can inline up to 40 scoped local resources, with a browser sandbox/CSP and no host-page access. It is not arbitrary Python execution, a dependency installer or a full development server. See [tool boundaries](TOOL-ECOSYSTEM.md).

## Collaboration in each round

Each round retains its own expandable collaboration panel when a new turn starts. Expand it to view member hierarchy, declared task dependencies and recorded communication arrows; select a node to inspect the corresponding work. Historical details load on demand. New member approval or question waits open the panel for attention.

Creation relationships are distinct from task dependencies. Communication counts represent submitted messages, not read receipts; older messages without structured records are not inferred. Graphs show up to 60 nodes, with all members available in the accompanying list.

## Model request recovery

Malformed tool arguments allow up to two correction requests per model step. Temporary connection failures or interrupted streams reconnect up to five times with 2/4/8/16/30-second delays; progress is visible and Stop cancels the wait. Successful responses reset these allowances. Only the failed model response is requested again: partial tool calls never execute and completed tool operations remain in context. Partial text is marked incomplete. Retries can incur additional provider charges; unavailable usage is not treated as measured zero. Credential/configuration errors are not retried automatically. After exhaustion, the run stops with a recoverable reason; an explicit model-step limit still applies.

## Long commands and timeout tests

A single ordinary command now waits up to 10 seconds, then returns the ID of the same still-running background process. Its execution timeout is unchanged; approval wait is excluded. The UI records the handoff and background progress. New messages wake background waits. The agent may do independent work, but must not change files, outputs or environments being used by that job. When no independent work remains, it waits for an event rather than polling the model.

Short commands return their original exit code/output. A scheduled job is not passing test evidence. Set yieldAfterSeconds=0 for strict synchronous completion, or background=true for immediate scheduling. Implicit multi-call batches, sequential workflows and hooks retain synchronous defaults to preserve dependencies. This does not create a filesystem lock or guarantee that the model always chooses useful parallel work. Already-running foreground commands on an older service are not retroactively detached.

## Pasted text and draft preview

Pasting at least 8,000 characters or 100 lines creates a Markdown text attachment using the existing upload path. It stays in the draft until sent, can be removed like other attachments, and does not become knowledge or memory automatically. Sending is disabled during that upload. Upload errors retain the source for retry or restoration to the draft.

Short Markdown/formula pastes open Preview; Edit returns to the unchanged source. Tables, fenced code and KaTeX math are supported. This is a source/preview editor, not a rich-text WYSIWYG editor. Draft previews do not execute HTML or fetch remote images. Existing attachment limits still apply.

### Updates and argument repair

Quick Start checks source fingerprints and rebuilds when the service is stopped. An already running service is only reopened; rebuilding files does not reload its in-memory code. Finish tasks and stop the service before running Start-Amadeus.cmd again. First-Start-Amadeus.cmd prepares locked dependencies and builds; it refuses to replace dependencies underneath a running service.

Malformed tool arguments get at most two consecutive repair attempts, reset after each successful model response. Exhaustion is a recoverable interruption; incomplete calls are never executed. Network reconnection is separate. Historical failures do not describe the currently installed implementation. Security review designs are untested suggestions, not evidence of vulnerability discovery or remediation.
