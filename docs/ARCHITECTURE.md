## Module boundaries

- `shared/`: domain and wire types; `server/storage/`: SQLite records, ordered events, effects and usage.
- `server/core/`: model loop, pump, lifecycle, context, delegation, team coordination and deterministic cognitive policy.
- `server/providers/`: protocol serialization, streaming, model discovery and measured usage.
- `server/tools/`: schemas, discovery, availability, permissions and audited invocation.
- `server/services/`: execution, approvals, files, knowledge, memory, media, MCP and background work.
- `server/http/`: authenticated loopback API/SSE; `src/`: React interface.

RunEnvironment builds scoped model facts through explicit dependencies without scheduling work. RunPump controls admission and draining; finalization and team coordination use separate modules. Runtime remains the composition root and model-loop coordinator: decomposition reduces coupling but does not eliminate it.

## Lifecycle and durable effects

Runs use queued, running, waiting_user, waiting_approval, waiting_children, completed, failed and interrupted states. Terminal runs are not resurrected; continuation creates a new run. Structured termination reasons distinguish recoverable limits/protocol interruption from failures.

Tool intent and results are journaled. Pre-start failures are not_started; ambiguous external effects remain unknown. Startup reconciliation atomically interrupts old runs and cancels orphaned inputs. Opt-in team recovery can start an inspected new turn; arbitrary commands are never replayed merely because the service restarted. See [recovery](INTERACTION.md).

SSE carries persisted event IDs with up to 1,000 replayed events; larger gaps request an authoritative snapshot. Token deltas are ephemeral, finalized content durable. Provider streams have request and byte-idle deadlines. The model loop retries transient failed or partial responses up to five times before any tool execution, with cancellable backoff. Completed tool results remain in checkpoints; no tool is replayed. Invalid argument repair is bounded per successful model step.

## Context and control

Measured main-request tokens calibrate local estimates; tool schemas and images contribute to capacity. Compaction preserves latest requests, complete recent tool pairs and an ordered verbatim request-source ledger. A summarizer failure may externalize older history to scoped spill storage. Protected requirements that still cannot fit produce an explicit error.

Repeated reads execute again before eligible reference/delta substitution. Source hashes, retained bases and model/tool configuration prevent stale reuse. No cached model answer or old test success substitutes for execution. See [prefix caching](DEEPSEEK-CACHE.md).

The cognitive controller derives repetition, progress and verification signals from observations, excludes event-driven waits, and emits bounded advice/recovery proposals. It is a deterministic policy, not another LLM agent. Follow-up assessments show observed change, not causal improvement.

## Teams

Plan compilation validates contracts and dependency graphs before scheduling. A read-only blackboard projects tasks, recipient-visible messages, artifacts, evidence and unknown effects; bounded selective context marks omitted entries. Source records stay authoritative.

Persistent members can continue through new runs while preserving conversation history. Isolation, ancestry, depth, permissions, current role revisions and unresolved effects still gate continuation. Writable child copies require versioned review/merge. Roles grant coordination authority, not permissions.

Model concurrency defaults to 3 per conversation; cumulative child executions default to 8 per tree. Explicit 0 disables that count limit, including continued members. Depth, budgets, provider quotas and team automation limits remain separate. See [routing](PLANNING-AND-ROUTING.md).

## Limits

This is a single-host runtime, not distributed consensus or exactly-once external execution. Provenance is not semantic correctness; filesystem observations are not adversarial locks. Broad held-out performance and security claims require independent evaluation.

Memory, policy and graph routes now live in server/http/memory.ts with explicit Store, Configuration and MemoryIndex dependencies. The HTTP composition root retains shared authentication and lifecycle hooks; this does not finish decomposing App.tsx or the tool registry.

## Evidence-driven reflection

Task snapshots include a bounded deterministic critique: declared goal completion, source-valid tool evidence, recorded checks, independent checks, stale checks, blockers and unknown effects. Evidence must belong to the same task tree; scheduled commands do not count as passing evidence. Suggested next checks target acceptance counterexamples. No correctness probability is fabricated, and missing undeclared requirements remain unknown. This extends the advisory controller; it does not add an autonomous critic model, force an adversarial team for every task, or establish learned optimal routing. Existing full/reference/delta context reuse remains unchanged.

### Security review and evidence-bound challenges

For software with trust boundaries, the assistant can discover `prepare_security_review`.
It produces **untested** counterexample designs for identity, authorization, untrusted
input, shared-state transitions, external events, secrets, and file/network access.
The assistant selects applicable surfaces and adds verification tasks to its plan.
Negative tests should have positive controls and inspect durable state. Execution
approval is permission to run a check, not a security review of the delivered application.

Concrete concerns can be persisted with `record_task_challenge`. Open challenges
block finalization of affected tasks. `resolve_task_challenge` requires the current
task verification event, generated after the challenge, with a successful receipt and
matching artifact stamps. Earlier green tests cannot close a new concern. Changed
contracts or stale artifact verification reopen resolved concerns. Author checks remain
distinguished from independent checks. Review-design and challenge tools cannot count
as completion evidence. The delivery loop allows two corrective attempts; it does not
retry uncertain effects or create an unlimited review loop.

These controls prove recorded check provenance, not that a test logically refutes a
concern. Selecting all relevant surfaces and discovering vulnerabilities still depend
on the model and available evidence. Static inspection may be recorded as such; it
must not be presented as an executed exploit test. There is no calibrated security
score, mandatory reviewer on every chat, or claim of vulnerability-free output.
Reflection exposes separate fact/plan/tool/evidence/memory/answer uncertainty states,
not fabricated probabilities. No new dependency or launcher change is required.

The host also injects review designs into task snapshots when declared task text matches risk surfaces or declared artifacts are source files. This heuristic does not require a user review request or a tool invocation. It does not cover absent plans, undeclared changes or every risk; checklist execution remains model-driven, while recorded open challenges are host-gated.


### Unified delivery evidence and convergence signals

The host projects task status, open challenges, applicable memory checks and unknown
effects into one read-only delivery report. It reuses the existing authorities rather
than maintaining a second mutable obligation ledger. `inspect_delivery_evidence`
refreshes artifact verification before returning the report; finalization refreshes
and uses the same blocker lists, recording a `delivery.assessed` event.

Red means an existing required gate is unresolved. Yellow means no such blocker but
recorded coverage gaps remain. Green only means the recorded required gates are
satisfied, never that the application is correct or secure. Empty evidence is
unassessed. A blocked task is not a pass. Reports link declared artifacts and acceptance
criteria to direct dependent verification tasks; all such checks must be recorded
before reporting successor coverage. Artifact inspection remains distinct from this
declared check relationship. Undeclared dependencies and logical test adequacy remain
unknown. Detailed reports are bounded to 100 entries and 50 impact rows with omitted
counts; blocker evaluation is not truncated. This is a tool/context report, not a new
UI traffic-light indicator or automatic risk classifier.

The deterministic controller separately tracks exact repeated trajectories and
repeated operation targets whose output varies. Eight repeated targets without
recorded task/check progress may trigger advisory plan review, at most once per
12 batches. This signal never independently stops a run: changing timestamps can
hide polling, but legitimate observation can also vary. Distinct request targets and
event-driven waits are not treated as this loop. Task/check progress resets the
window. Target novelty is a distinct-request ratio, not semantic novelty or a
calibrated confidence estimate. Existing unchanged-cycle limits remain enforced.

No new dependency, database migration or first-start change is needed. Restart the
service to load backend changes; starting a second launcher does not reload an
already-running service.


### Closing the progress feedback loop

After a tool batch settles, existing recorded checks are refreshed against current
declared artifact/dependency stamps before cognitive observation. This reuses the
verification service and does not execute tests. Modified artifacts can therefore
produce coverage-regression feedback before final delivery.

Progress records both gains and losses: reopened/removed completed tasks and lost
recorded checks take priority over simultaneous new completions. Such a transition
requests verification, not automatic replay. Scope revision may explain the change;
the signal is not itself proof of a software defect. A replacement current check
does not count as loss. Existing final gates still determine completion.

Run-local context now includes the latest intervention assessment and any pending
bounded recovery proposal, including when no task board exists. Resolved or older
than four batches recovery proposals are omitted. Reset and separate runs do not
inherit the feedback. Changing a trajectory remains distinct from verification;
coverage regression is recorded separately in learning outcome summaries. No
confidence boost, automatic experience activation, new critic model or permission
grant results from these observations. Existing evidence-backed experience formation
and next-task memory checks remain the learning boundary. No new dependencies or
startup changes; backend restart is required to load this revision.


### Guarded recovery inspections

A recovery proposal has a unique ID. The agent can discover `inspect_recovery_step`
and select a current step through the normal tool registry and permission checks.
The dispatcher accepts only three diagnostic kinds: inspect recorded effects,
refresh declared artifact verification, or inspect the delivery report. It does not
run commands, arbitrary paths, installations, rollback, tests or permission changes.
Other proposal kinds stay with normal guarded tools or a user scope decision.

Each run/proposal/step is claimed once and has an audit receipt. Duplicate calls
return that receipt, including an unfinished or failed inspection; they do not
re-execute it. New execution requires a current pending proposal no more than four
batches old. Reset removes the proposal, and a superseded or foreign ID is rejected.
A crash during inspection can leave an inspecting receipt; it is diagnostic state,
not an effect-resolution claim or a new completion blocker.

Receipts return to run-local cognitive context. Inspection is not recovery success,
does not resolve unknown effects, and cannot satisfy task completion evidence.
The existing outcome assessment still distinguishes verified progress from a changed
strategy. This is bounded diagnostic dispatch, not autonomous arbitrary recovery or
a learned policy optimizer. No dependencies, migrations or launcher changes.
