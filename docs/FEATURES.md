## Conversations and projects

General conversations use private chat-file storage, not a project command workspace. Projects support up to 12 non-overlapping folders. Add/remove folders through project management. Removing a project archives access, not disk files; permanent chat deletion requires confirmation and does not delete project files. Conversation forks share project files; isolated worker copies are different.

The UI supports English/Chinese, a custom assistant name, automatic text sizing and 25–150% presets. Copy conversations/code, rate replies, navigate rounds and inspect context, usage, workspace and changes. Steps and resolved interactions can collapse. Plans appear when a task board exists. See [interaction](INTERACTION.md) and [formatting](CHAT-FORMATTING.md).

## Models and tools

Connections cover OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Responses, Anthropic and Gemini adapters. Discovery uses returned metadata; unsupported or absent fields remain configurable, not proven capabilities. Reasoning choices depend on each configured model. Images enter capable models through attachments or read_image; a capability declaration alone is not a live test.

Skills load progressively and can be batch-selected, filtered by source/category and optionally classified using a disclosed model destination. Imports do not grant tools, credentials or dependencies. Guarded preparation and local versioned packages complement discovery. See [tools](TOOL-ECOSYSTEM.md).

## Teams and waiting

Choose single-agent, automatic delegation or preferred collaboration; team topology additionally offers lead/workers, host-scheduled peers and creative peers. Host scheduling checks dependencies, resources, permissions, isolation and capacity before feedback-informed ranking.

Persistent members use continuation instead of requiring a new identity every turn. Optional recovery, bounded expansion/retirement and role takeover remain single-host policies. Creative messages are claims or fiction, not verification.

Background commands and deferred approvals let the model perform independent work while a job waits; dependent work must await its result. Ordinary foreground tool calls may still block that run. Other conversations have separate admission limits. No extra waiting agent is required.

## Knowledge and memory

Ordinary-chat shared memory/library, project scope and private conversation documents stay distinct. Authorized folder maintenance handles incremental parsing, versions, OCR, vectors and failures. Local multilingual E5 and remote embedding are supported; ANN is a local search index, not a language model. See [memory](MEMORY.md).

## Media

Separate providers cover image, video, music, speech, transcription and 3D protocols. Configure actual model IDs, options and credentials; protocol support is not universal live validation. Prices are estimates, not invoices.

Generated outputs have same-conversation handles. list_media finds old jobs; inspect_media checks bytes; read_image views images; export_media copies exact bytes to an authorized new project path. Image/audio/video handles may feed later generation where the provider supports the field/format. 3D files can be exported but are not generic generation references. Dictation inserts editable text rather than sending it. See [media tools](TOOL-ECOSYSTEM.md).

## Automation boundaries

Memory defaults, document maintenance, schedules and team recovery are opt-in and scope-bound. Schedules require the service to run. Scope expansion, new external destinations, credentials and uncertain destructive outcomes remain user-controlled. Automatic approval does not bypass isolation. See [security](SECURITY.md).
