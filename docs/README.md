## Maintenance convention

Update both language guides when behavior changes. Date results and identify code/grader versions and boundaries. Archive superseded facts instead of replacing old counts with new ones. Commands should name public entry points; skipped tests are not passes. Documentation maintenance does not rerun every historical API/OS experiment.
