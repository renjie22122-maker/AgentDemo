# Testing and evidence

## Current verification baseline

On 2026-10-05, the Amadeus rename at d663030 passed 333 tests, with 2 explicitly skipped environment-dependent tests, plus TypeScript and production build. This documentation update does not constitute new paid-model or OS-isolation testing. The build still reports large chunks.

Run from repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Use pnpm 11.19.0 and Node.js 24+. CI runs the checks on Ubuntu and Windows. A local pass is not a claim that a later remote CI job passed.

Optional host tests:

```powershell
$env:AGENTDEMO_BROWSER_TEST = '1'
node --import tsx --test tests/browser-tabs.test.ts
$env:AGENTDEMO_DESKTOP_TEST = '1'
node --import tsx --test tests/window-capture.test.ts
```

The desktop fixture creates its own windows and tests covered-window capture/minimized rejection; it is not a broad application benchmark. A skip is not a pass.

## What evidence means

A tool receipt proves that an observation occurred against recorded artifacts, not semantic correctness. File coverage comes from actual matching reads; command exit zero does not check every declared file. Verification tasks require a passed observation before done; owner self-check and another-run check are distinct. A different run alone does not ensure independent reasoning.

Snapshots include declared artifacts/read paths, package/config manifests and recognizable relative JS/TS imports. Bounds: 512 entries, 4 MB/file, 16 MB total. Incomplete inputs reject binding. Dynamic imports, external resolution and undeclared dependencies are not fully covered. Before/after hashes detect many stale cases, not adversarial TOCTOU.

Tests include negative controls, crash windows, unknown effects, startup state combinations, permissions, source scopes and replay prevention. They do not exhaust every runtime sequence or certify isolation.

## Benchmarks

- [Coding pilot](../evals/coding/README.md): production runtime on small synthetic tasks; both arms 10/10, with no reuse/compaction exercised.
- [Planning](../evals/planning/README.md): proposal protocol and graph checks, not delivered code or worker throughput.
- [Context/control](../evals/context-control/README.md): paired synthetic probes; no demonstrated implementation benefit.
- [Approval history](APPROVAL-EVALUATION.md): 0 percentage-point incremental reduction on its small balanced sample.

API usage omissions and unconfigured prices remain unknown. Cached tokens are a subset of input, not extra tokens. Historical reports are dated and kept in [history](history/README.md); no numeric capability rating is inferred.

CI also checks current bilingual guide pairs and local link targets, builds backend assets and smoke-tests compiled HTTP/isolated parsing, image codec and ONNX module loading. These checks do not prove document semantic freshness, clean-machine embedding inference or sandbox correctness.
