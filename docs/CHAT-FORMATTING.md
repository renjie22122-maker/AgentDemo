# Rich conversation content

[English](CHAT-FORMATTING.md) | [简体中文](CHAT-FORMATTING.zh-CN.md) · [Documentation](README.md)

The renderer supports standard Markdown headings, lists, task lists, tables, links, images, syntax-highlighted fenced code and KaTeX math. Code blocks have copy and collapse controls. Large formulas scroll horizontally.

## Bold text and literal syntax

Complete bold spans next to Chinese punctuation have a compatibility pass when ordinary Markdown leaves the stars visible. Code blocks, inline code, explicitly escaped stars and unfinished streaming spans are preserved. This is intentionally conservative: it does not attempt to repair every malformed Markdown document or rewrite stored messages.

## Attributed quotations

Use an explicit, general-purpose speaker label:

```markdown
> [speaker: Reviewer]
> The evidence supports this conclusion.

> [speaker: Author]
> I will update the implementation.
```

The UI shows a name and a deterministic color. Chinese `[角色: 名字]` is also accepted. This works for interviews, discussions, reviews, fiction and other attributed quotations. Ordinary blockquotes stay ordinary; no speaker is inferred. Colors use a six-color palette and can repeat, so names remain the primary identity.

## Math and interactive examples

Use `$x^2$` / `$$...$$` or LaTeX `\( ... \)` / `\[ ... \]` delimiters. KaTeX is not a complete TeX document compiler.

A fenced `html` or `html-preview` block displays its interactive preview by default. Switch between Preview and Code in the same-sized panel; code scrolls internally. Switching preserves the iframe state; Reset reloads it. Choose compact, standard or tall height, or resize vertically. A fenced `mermaid` block renders local relationship, flow, sequence, state and entity diagrams with the same preview/code switch. Mermaid uses strict mode and an inert SVG image; parse errors leave the source accessible.

The iframe has an opaque origin, scripts only (no same-origin, top-navigation, popup or form sandbox privileges), and a CSP restricting resource loads and connections. It cannot access the parent application's DOM/storage. This is a browser preview boundary, not an OS sandbox: it does not guarantee resource limits or prevent every possible navigation. Do not use it as a general execution environment for hostile programs. Remote dependencies, arbitrary Python execution, package installation and full development-server projects are not supported. Raw HTML in ordinary Markdown remains escaped/ignored.

## Media and dictation

Generated image, video and audio outputs stay anchored to the first media-task event. Subsequent updates replace that card in place rather than moving it to a later turn. Existing generated-media cards provide players, downloads and collapse controls. Recognized local conversation media links with audio/video extensions can also embed a player; arbitrary remote links are not automatically converted into players.

The microphone icon is next to **Send**. Configure a transcription connection in Settings first. Recording requires browser microphone permission and a supported browser on localhost or HTTPS. Stop recording, then choose Upload & transcribe. The result enters an editable draft; it is not sent as a chat message automatically. This is dictation, not real-time voice conversation.

## Validation

See [verification](VERIFICATION.md) for the current regression baseline. A real headless Edge fixture verified default previews, state-preserving switches, same-sized scrolling code, two Mermaid diagrams and mobile width. TypeScript and the production build passed. No paid media service was called.

## Interactive results

HTML components in completed assistant messages can submit a result through the optional bridge:

```js
window.amadeus?.submitResult({
  title: 'Scenario comparison',
  data: { option: 'A', total: 42 },
});
// Alternatively: { title: 'Feedback', text: 'Your result' }
```

Each submission creates a separate record. Users can edit a record, select several records, and append the current or selected results to the existing chat draft. Only pressing the normal Send button delivers them to the model. This supports repeated simulations, games, forms and calculators; it is not specific to dice. Existing components must call the bridge to report results.

The toolbar follows the selected interface language and provides Preview/Code tabs, height selection, copy and reset. Switching views or language preserves component state.

The host checks the sending iframe, opaque origin, instance token and payload shape. Records are untrusted component-reported data, not verified evidence or permission grants. Titles allow 100 characters and result text 16,000; each mounted component retains at most 20 records and visibly rejects overflow. Remove a record before submitting more. Batch draft insertion may require splitting large selections.

Pending records are local UI state, not durable storage: reset, reload or unmount can discard them. Results already added to a draft follow ordinary draft behavior; sent messages follow ordinary conversation persistence. Client-side buttons cannot guarantee durable once-only rolls or tamper-proof outcomes. Components cannot automatically send messages, call tools or access host storage. No new dependency or launcher change is required; existing startup scripts rebuild changed frontend sources.

## Preview sizing

HTML and SVG previews default to Fit content. Height follows content changes, image loads and available width without resetting component state; source view remains scrollable. Fit window, Compact, Standard and Tall remain available. Long content is capped at 2400px with an explicit hint so an untrusted component cannot expand the chat indefinitely. Viewport-relative layouts or internally scrolling widgets may still scroll.

Size messages are accepted only from the current sandbox iframe with the current token; the preview retains its opaque origin and restrictive CSP. A size message cannot submit a result or access host tools.
